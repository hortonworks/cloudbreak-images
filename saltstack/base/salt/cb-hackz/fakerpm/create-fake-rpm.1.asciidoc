NAME
----
create-fake-rpm - generate fake (S)RPM.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*create-fake-rpm* [--help] [--print-result] [--version=VERSION] [--requires=PACKAGE] [--release=RELEASE] [--build] PACKAGE_NAME PROVIDES


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This script creates empty RPM package to satisfy the dependencies.

It may be useful when you install some library/module/application manually - without having an RPM package.
E.g., when you

  pip install somepackage

And when some RPM package `Requires: python-somepackage` then /usr/bin/rpm refuses to install such package,
because `python-somepackage` is not present on your system.
RPMDB does not know what you know. So you can run:

  create-fake-rpm --build python-somepackage python3dist(somepackage)

This create package `fake-python-somepackage-0-0.noarch.rpm` which provides: "python-somepackage" and "python3dist(somepackage)".
You can install it using:

  dnf install fake-python-somepackage-0-0.noarch.rpm

!!!! WARNING !!!!

This is a big gun. You can easily shot yourself in a leg.
Do not use this tool unless you know what you are doing.
And if you know what you are doing - then think twice before you use it.
You can easily destroy your machine with this tool.

OPTIONS
-------

--version=VERSION - you can specify version of your package. Default is 0.

--release=RELEASE - you can specify RELEASE of your package. Default is 0.

--requires=PACKAGE - make the resulting rpm require another one, useful for compatibility cases where packages have different names. Can be used multiple times.

--build - create an RPM package. Without this option, only SRC.RPM package will be created.
