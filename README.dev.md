# Custom Images for Cloudbreak

This section covers advanced topics for building Custom Images.

## Customizing the Base Image

If you would like to start from a customized image, you could either:

- Set Packer to start from your [own custom image](#custom_base)
- Add your [custom logic](#custom_logic) - either as custom script or as custom [Salt]((https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/)) state
- Use [Oracle JDK](#oracle-java) instead of OpenJDK

### <a name="custom_base"></a> Custom Base Image

You have the option to start from your own pre-created source image, you have to modify the relevant section in the `builders` in the [packer.json](packer.json) file.

The following table lists the property to be modified to be able to start from a custom image:  

 Cloud Provider | Builder Name | Base Source Image Properties
 ---- | ---- | ----
 AWS | aws-amazonlinux | `source_ami: "ami-9398d3e0"` and `"region": "..."`
 AWS | aws-centos6 | `source_ami: "ami-edb9069e"` and `"region": "..."`
 AWS | aws-centos7 | `source_ami: "ami-061b1560"` and `"region": "..."`
 AWS | aws-rhel7 | `source_ami: "ami-b22961c1"` and `"region": "..."`
 AWS | aws-debian7 | `source_ami: "ami-61e56916"` and `"region": "..."`
 Azure | arm-centos7 |  driven by input parameters:`image_publisher`, ` image_offer` and `image_sku`
 Google Cloud | gc-centos7 | `source_image: "centos-7-v20160921"`
 OpenStack | os-centos7 | `source_image: "d619e553-6a78-4b86-8b03-39b8a06df35e"`

> Note: For Azure, you can list popular images as written in [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/cli-ps-findimage#list-popular-images), but please note that only RHEL and CentOS is supported.
 
#### AWS Example

1. For this example, suppose you have your own RHEL 7 AMI `ami-XXXXXXXX` in region `us-east-1` in your AWS account.
2. Open the [packer.json](packer.json) file.
3. Find the section for `builders` and the section `"name": "aws-rhel7"`.
4. Modify the properties `source_ami` and `region` to match the AMI in your AWS account.
5. Save the [packer.json](packer.json) file.
6. Proceed to [AWS](README.md#aws) and run the **Build Command** for RHEL 7.

### <a name="custom_logic"></a> Custom Script

Cloudbreak uses [SaltStack](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/) for image provisioninig. You have an option to extend the factory scripts based on custom requirements.

> Warning: This is very advanced option. Understanding the following content requires a basic understanding of the concepts of [SaltStack](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/). Please read the relevant sections of the documentation.

The provisioning steps are implemented with [Salt state files](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/states_pt1.html), there is a placeholder state file called `custom`. The following section describes the steps required to extend this `custom` state with either your own script or Salt state file.
 
 1. Check the contents of the following directory:  `saltstack/salt/custom`, it provides extension points for implementing custom logic. The contents of the directory are the following:
 
| Filename | Description | 
| ---- | ---- |
| `init.sls` |  Top level descriptor for state, it references other state files |
| `custom.sls` | Example for custom state file, by default it contains the example of copying and running `custom.sh` with some basic logging configured |
| `/tmp/custom.sh` | Placeholder for custom logic |
 
 2. You have the following options to extend this state:
 - You can place your scripts inside `custom.sh`  
 - You can copy and reference your scripts like `custom.sh` is referred from `custom.sls`. 
 For each new file, a `file.managed` state is needed to copy the script to the VM and a `cmd.run` state is needed to actually run and log the script. 
 - You can create and reference your state file like `custom.sls` is referred from `init.sls`. You can include any custom Salt states, if your new sls files are included in `init.sls`, they will be applied automatically  
 
 > Warning: Please ensure that your script runs without any errors or mandatory user inputs

### <a name="oracle-java"></a>Oracle JDK

By default, OpenJDK is installed on the images. Alternatively, you can install Oracle JDK by using the optional Salt state.

To enable Oracle JDK installation you have to set the `OPTIONAL_STATES` environment variable:

`export OPTIONAL_STATES="oracle-java"`

Default Oracle JDK URL is for 8u151, but you can choose another from  [Oracle JDK 8 download site](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
> Warning: Please use Linux x64 RPM version

If you choose other version use the following to set the download URL for the Oracle JDK:
`export ORACLE_JDK8_URL_RPM="https://www.oracle.com/path-to-jdk-rpm-file"`
 

## Packer Postprocessors

By default all Packer postprocessors are removed before build. This behaviour can be changed by setting the: 
```
export ENABLE_POSTPROCESSORS=1
```
 
For example a postprocessor could be used to store image metadata into  [HashiCorp Atlas](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/atlas-announcement/) for further processing. 

If you don't know how postprocessors are working then you can safely ignore this section and please do NOT set ENABLE_POSTPROCESSORS=1 unless you know what you are doing.
