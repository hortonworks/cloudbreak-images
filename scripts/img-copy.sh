#!/bin/bash

# This script is a helper meant for copying images to your own account.
# Currently it supports AWS only and requires the below parameters:
#
#  1 Source AWS account (from which the image is being copied)
#  2 AWS Credentials profile name
#  3 AMI ID
#  4 target regions, commma separated
#
# To have the proper AWS credentials, you'll need to use gimme-aws-creds along with
# Okta - this is the company standard, but technically nothing prevents you
# from setting up a custom ~/.aws/credentials file. Contents the credentials file
# will also provide you the necessary value for the AWS credentials profile name.
# Having Docker installed on your machine is also required to run this script.
#
# Example use:
# ./img-copy.sh 1234567890123 default ami-0073e5fb98e2faa3f eu-north-1,eu-west-3
#
# This will cause you to end up with a whole lot of log on the standard out, ending
# with something like this:
# + echo '2023-11-23 11:00:32+00:00 Image copied to regions: eu-north-1=ami-0b7149651a90989f3,eu-west-3=ami-0fb5aa19986c12ec8'
# Now you can copy those AMI references into a custom catalog.
#
# If you run into the below error message when the script finishes, it means that 
# your account can't have public AMIs:
#   "An error occurred (OperationNotPermitted) when calling the ModifyImageAttribute 
#    operation: You canâ€™t publicly share this image because block public access for
#    AMIs is enabled for this account. To publicly share the image, you must call 
#    the DisableImageBlockPublicAccess API."
# Having public AMIs is a must though, as Cloudbreak needs to access them, so you'll 
# have to enable this in the account.
#
# Note: Regardless of the above error message, the AMI copy should be successful.
